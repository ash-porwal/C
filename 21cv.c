// /* in this wrong swap is not working cuz here we are doing CALL BY VALUE means we are sending copy of a and b */

//So the main point here is that when the call by value method is used it doesnâ€™t change the actual values because copies of actual values are sent to the function.

/*In the case of call by pointer, the address of actual parameters is sent to the formal parameter, which means that if we change the values inside 
the function that will affect the actual values */
